       * ~~E-mail: Pushed from form/component~~
       * ~~Password (Hashed): Pushed from form/component~~
       * ~~Address: Geometrical co-ordinates: Pushed from form/component~~
       * ~~Mobile: Pushed from form/component~~
       * ~~Type: (Manufacturer, Supplier, Sub-Supplier) : Pushed from form/component~~
    
    * ~~Part Request: To store supplier details for a product.
       * ~~request.id: Generated by mongo schema~~ 
       * ~~user.id (Manufacturer): Fetch from session variable~~
       * ~~user.type: Fetch from session variable~~
       * ~~Part Name: Fetched from form~~
